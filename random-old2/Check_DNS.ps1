## Sometimes, in some projects, you'll deploy a lot of 
## servers and a good practice is to make a DNS record, 
## eighter they are created dynamically or you have to 
## punch them manually.  It's time consuming doing
## a manual nslookup for checking if a DNS record exists
## and are registered correctly!
##
## This script use your local defined DNS server for lookup,
## and a comma separated textfile with IP, FQDN.
##
## The comma separated file needs a header like this "IP";"FQDN"
##


## Check for arguments typed in command line.

		$test = $true
